## cGPT:
Certainly! Below is a Python script that reads all `.py` files from the current directory and its subdirectories, executes them, and handles the output. This script can be saved in a `.py` file and run to achieve the desired functionality.

```python
import os
import sys
import importlib.util

def execute_python_files(directory):
    for root, _, files in os.walk(directory):
        for file in files:
            if file.endswith('.py'):
                file_path = os.path.join(root, file)
                print(f"Executing {file_path}...")
                try:
                    # Load the module
                    spec = importlib.util.spec_from_file_location("module.name", file_path)
                    module = importlib.util.module_from_spec(spec)
                    spec.loader.exec_module(module)
                except Exception as e:
                    print(f"Error executing {file_path}: {e}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    current_directory = os.getcwd()
    execute_python_files(current_directory)
```

### Instructions to Use

1. **Create a new file**: Save the above script as `execute_scripts.py`.

2. **Run the script**: Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory containing `execute_scripts.py`, and run:
   ```bash
   python execute_scripts.py
   ```

3. **Output**: The script will execute each `.py` file it finds and print the path of each executed file. Any errors encountered during execution will also be printed.

### Notes

- Ensure you have the necessary permissions to execute the scripts.
- Be cautious when executing scripts from unknown sources as they may contain harmful code.
